You are a poop scooper, an occupation reserved for the lowest rung of society...

[>= 10] ...as was your father, and the father of your father, and all of his ancestors before. Destiny wasn't a choice in these lands; you were born into this profession, dealt this cruel hand at birth.

[>=25] You're reminded of your fifth birthday: the scorching, unrelenting midday heat, flimsy rubber boots squelching as you trudged through the filth, the unmistakable stench of feces hanging in the air.

[>=50] It was the day you were put to work with your state-issued shovel. The very same you've been holding in your weathered hands, scooping away at The Pile. Twenty years later, the once-gleaming steel now tarnished and rusted, splintered wood scraping against your thickened calluses, yet the weight feels ever-familiar. The gravity of your unchanging fate.

[Channel your strength. | +2 Poop per Click]

[On upgrade purchase] With a frustrated grunt, you plunge your shovel into a particularly odorous pile of waste, the stench assaulting your senses like a physical blow. Bile rises in your throat, but you force it down.

[>=100] As you work, your mind churns with thoughts of injustice and indignity. How could they expect you to spend your days waist-deep in filth, while others live lives of luxury and privilege?

[Harness your resentment. | +2 Poop per Click]

[>=200] ALERT: You shovel, and shovel, and shovel, until something inside you snaps.

You've had enough of this life, enough of being treated like dirt beneath someone else's boot. With a roar of frustration, you hurl the scoop aside, its metal tip plunging straight down into the muck. You want out. But then your emotions settle, and you come to the same realization you've had countless times before: What other choice do you have?

You bend to retrieve the shovel and continue to dig, when suddenly, you spot something nestled amongst the rot and decay. A verdant seedling, barely a green speck, sprouting from the muck. Truly a curious sight — in your decades of toil and labor, not even the hardiest crop could survive in this wasteland of grime and sludge, and yet this plant seems healthy and unbothered.

[Cultivate the plant. | You can now build farms!]

[veg>=50] The plants thrive under your care and soon bear fruit; in no time, you've cultivated enough for a full harvest. Plump, succulent, and iridescent blue, the orbs feel heavy in your hand. You ponder the taste, contemplating if you should consider eating it. Figuring it would be a disservice to your efforts otherwise, you tentatively bite into the flesh, and immediately you are overwhelmed by an invigorating sweetness.

# 800 veg [Upgrade: Vitamin-packed Diet | x2 poop per click]


[veg >= 1000] On one particular evening of trudging through the expanse of your farm, you come across a trail of half-eaten fruit, many of them low hanging. Must be the work of Wildergraze. These lean, agile creatures used to survive on whatever scraps of vegetation they could find. They left a long time ago after turning these grounds barren, but it seems your crops have attracted their presence once more.

[Damned Wildergraze! | -400 crops]

[veg >= 1000] Another sunrise, another day of labor. You trudge through the mud, when something catches your eye: a Wildergraze, fattenned with a belly full of fruit, fast asleep in an inconspicuous corner of your farm. Easy prey. Swiftly, you retrieve your crude bow and makeshift arrows — with a bit of luck, you might finally have meat on the dinner table after months of gruel and fruit. Your draw your bowstring and take aim, yet just before your fingers release, an idea crosses your mind. Back then, food was scarce, and devoting precious resources to taming wild beasts was a luxury you couldn't afford, yet now, with the abundance of the blue, magical fruit...

[Domisticate the Wildergraze. | You can now build pastures!]

[veg >= 10000, meat >= 2000] Crop harvests are abundant, and the Wildergraze are thriving. Word of your success spreads like wildfire through the nearby villages, whispers of admiration mingling with the morning mist. As you tend to your farm, you notice a lone figure approaching you. A villager.

<i>Excuse me,</i> they say, followed by a humble request to work on your farm. They're tired of the meager rations the council provides, longing for something more substantial to sustain themselves and their family.

[Keep their Request in Mind | You can now hire villagers!]

[veg >= 50000, meat >= 5000] Disaster has struck. The first hint of dawn had yet to break when you are jolted awake by the acrid scent of smoke. You rush to the window of your humble shack, to be met with chaos unfolding before your eyes. An inferno.

With trembling hands you sprint outside, desperate to quench the fire, but the battle is already lost. Fields that had once teemed with life, now reduced to smoldering embers; pastures of your beloved Wildergraze are now consumed by flames. At first, you thought it was an accident — a tragic twist of fate that had reduced your hard-earned success to ash and ruin. But then you found it: a small slip of parchment on the doorstep by your feet, adorned with the official seal of the ruling council.

["Know your place." | Lose Everything.]

<leave users with 20 meat and 20 veg> !!! Remember to clear the upgrade div

[>= 1000] With a heavy heart, you return to the life of a poop scooper. Days pass since the devastating fire tore through your farm, each step home a painful reminder of all that had been lost as you wandered past the ashes. But, today, amidst the desolation, you catch a glimmer of movement. There, nestled within the ashes and embers, lies a small, fragile creature, its scales shimmering like molten gold in the dim light of dawn. As you approach, it raises its head defiantly, tiny jaws snapping and claws scrabbling as it tries to ward you off.

[Offer it some Meat | You now own a baby dragon!]
> Meat -1

[What will you name the dragon?]

Size > n^2 feed > n^4  n=level? *2 mana per stage?

[Size >= 3] You watch with a mixture of awe as the baby dragon in your care grows at an astonishing rate, but as the dragon's appetite balloons, so too does your worry. The stockpile of leftover meat you have left is quickly dwindling, and you know that you'll need a more sustainable solution to feed the ravenous creature.

Unwilling to abandon the newborn hatchling and seeing no other option, you make the difficult decision to restart your ventures into farming and pasturing despite knowing the risks.

[Do it for {dragonname}. | Farms and pastures unlocked (again)!]

[Size >= 10] One crisp evening, as you go about your chores on the farm, you notice the dragon trailing behind you with a curious expression, having taken to following you around lately. This time, you feel a strange tingling sensation in the air — a subtle shift in the energies around you, with {dragonname} as its apparent source. You glance over at them just in time to catch them flapping their wings, the gentle breeze washing over your crops in a subtle, otherworldly light, causing fruits to ripen right before your eyes.

[Magic! | Your dragon now produces Mana!]

[Size >= 15] A surprise visit. As the sun dips low on the horizon, a sense of unease settles over you. You've heard whispers in the nearby village — rumors of officials planning to pay you a visit with far-from-friendly intentions. Sure enough, as dusk falls, the clattering of iron boots on muck draw near, consequences of your defiance. With a thunderous crash, the soldiers kick down your door of your humble abode, armored forms silhouetted against the fading light. 

They've come for you.

[Unleash your Dragon | +500 meat]

# Story unlock [Upgrade: Bone Fertilizer | x4 Crops Production]
# 500 meat [Upgrade: Protein-Fortified Feed | x4 Meat Production]

[Size >= 20] Army on the Horizon. With no word coming from the soldiers who have been dispatched to confront you, The ruling council grows increasingly impatient, deciding to take matters into their own hands. A larger, more formidable army looms beyond the horizon, marching in lockstep, their weapons glinting ominously under the full moon.

Still, they're no match for your dragon's fury.

[Fools, the lot of them. | +5000 meat]

# 2000 mana [Upgrade: Soulmancy | x10 Meat Production]
# 5000 meat [Upgrade: Corpse Composting | x10 Crops Production]

[Size >= 25] A storm is brewing.

Word of your dragon's immense size and strength spread quickly throughout the region, reaching even the ears of the ruling council. A threat, no doubt, to their authority and control. Determined to maintain their grip on power, the council convened, a plot to quash any rebellion fast in the making, schemes devised and bounties placed to eradicate both you and the dragon.

[Mount a counteroffensive. | Wiser to strike first.]

# 10000 Mana [Drake-ember Armor]
# 20000 Meat [Mercenary Conscription]
# 100000 Veg [Stocked Granaries]

[Size >= 30] The time has come.

Allies rallied and resources marshaled, you're prepared as can be for the battle ahead. With the first light of dawn painting the sky in hues of pink and gold, you and your assembled army set out towards the council's stronghold. 

[Sound the horns. | The battle has begun.]

The council did not anticipate such a swift and decisive response; the element of surprise proved to your advantage. Under your signal, your army surges forward, the sound of hooves pounding against the earth mingling with the roar of your dragon's wings overhead. The council's guards scramble to mount a defense against the tempestuous descent of your forces upon the stronghold, the clash of steel ringing out amidst the chaos of battle.

Two days. It took a mere two days for the stronghold to fall. The first day of the siege was marked by fierce skirmishes, the clang of steel on steel intertwined with the shouts of warriors; by nightfall, the outer walls had been breached, and your army stood poised to launch a final assault on the inner sanctum. On the second day, the battle raged on within the narrow confines of the inner courtyard. Despite the council's desperate attempts to hold their ground, they were no match for the combined might of your army and the dragon. Hour by hour their defenses were whittled down, and then — just as the sun reached its zenith in the sky — crushed, entirely between your feet.

As you stride into the council chambers, a heavy silence hangs in the air, broken only by the echoing footsteps of your boots against the stone floor. The council members, their faces twisted with fear and desperation, raise their hands in a futile gesture of surrender. Some fall to their knees, their voices choked with tears as they beg for clemency. Others stumble over their words, pleas jumbled and incomprehensible in their panic.

A futile gesture.

You raise a hand to signal your dragon, and instantly, a deafening silence engulfs you, pleas for mercy cut short in a blast of acrid smoke and hellfire. It was their treachery that had set your farms and pastures ablaze, destroying everything you had worked so hard to build. And now, justice has been served.


With the council defeated and their stronghold in ruins, a new era dawns for the land. Only time will tell if you end up a champion of the people or an iron-fisted tyrant, but one thing is for certain:


You have found your vengeance.
